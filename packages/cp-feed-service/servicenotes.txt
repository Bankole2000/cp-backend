>>>: Service Startup: 
check for <appname>-feed hash in redis store
- if doesn't exist, create and add global field

>>>: Generating Feeds
When new post is published, add postId to global list, and country list
For global list Fetch from post service order by createdAt?
for country list fetch from post service filter by country Code order by createdAt?
?? Suggested posts
?? Promoted posts
?? Posts by tags or by search params
When user is created, userId is used as key in <appname>-feed hash in redis store
if post author is followed by logged in user, 
  then postId is added to userId feed list in redis (lpush)

When user requests feed,
take 9 postIds from user feed list in redis
  lrange <username>:feed 0 4
take 3 postIds from promoted posts
add promoted postIds to userFeed List PostIds (at intervals of 3)
fetch post Data (how to get promoted posts data??)
add post Ids to userFeed in storage (as fed posts)
send posts to client.

NOTE: No need to log feed request response
